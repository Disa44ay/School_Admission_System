# School Admission System

First-come, first-served seat booking for school admissions. ASP.NET Core (.NET 10) API, React + Vite frontend, PostgreSQL 18.

**Status:** feature-complete. All 8 endpoints work. The bilingual UI (Bangla by default, English switch) is at http://localhost:5173. 42 backend tests, 12 frontend tests and a 14-step Playwright end-to-end check pass in Docker.

## Run

Requires only Docker with Compose v2.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| API | http://localhost:8080 |
| API health | http://localhost:8080/health (200 when the database is reachable, 503 when it isn't) |
| PostgreSQL | No host port. To inspect it: `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d school_admission` |

CI (GitHub Actions) runs on every push. It builds the images, starts the stack, checks both URLs and runs the backend and frontend tests.

## Using the UI

The UI opens in Bangla on the **অভিভাবক** (Parent) view. **EN** switches to English.

- **Parent:**
  1. Type the 17-digit birth registration number at the top. Bangla digits work too. It's saved in the browser and used as soon as it's valid.
  2. Press **আবেদন করুন** (Apply) on a class to hold a seat.
  3. The admission slip shows a live countdown, with **ভর্তি ফি দিন** (Pay) and **বাতিল** (Cancel).
  4. At 0 the hold shows **মেয়াদ উত্তীর্ণ** (Expired) and the seat frees, with no reload.
- **অ্যাডমিন (Admin):** pick a class (1–10), a shift and the number of seats to create a class. The table shows total, held, confirmed and available seats for every class.
- Seat counts refresh every 3 seconds.
- If the server can't be reached, a banner says so and the last data stays on screen.

Stop with `docker compose down`. Data survives in the `pgdata` volume. `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

## Configuration

No `.env` file is needed. Every value has a default. To change one, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, or set it in the shell:

```bash
HOLD_DURATION_SECONDS=2 docker compose up --build
```

| Variable | Used by | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `HOLD_DURATION_SECONDS` | API | `600` (also used when the value is invalid or 0 or less) |
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | API: the first one set wins | the compose `db` service |
| `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | db | `school_admission`, `postgres`, `postgres` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, then `VITE_API_URL` | frontend build | `http://localhost:8080` |

## Tests

Backend tests (xUnit, against a real PostgreSQL in compose; each run uses a throwaway database):

```bash
docker compose --profile test run --rm backend-tests
```

Frontend tests (Vitest + React Testing Library, jsdom):

```bash
docker compose --profile test run --rm frontend-tests
```

End-to-end browser check (Playwright, against the running stack; optional, needs Python with `playwright` and Chromium installed):

```bash
HOLD_DURATION_SECONDS=15 docker compose up -d --build
```

```bash
python -X utf8 e2e/ui_e2e.py
```

Results and screenshots are in `automatedTestAndResults.md` and `e2e/screenshots/`.
